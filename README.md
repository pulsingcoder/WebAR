After working with Unity AR transparent video, I decided to make same in web AR to allow user to use without any app to download

<BR>
1.) A-Frame <BR>
2.) Javascript <BR>
3.) HTML

Used chroma green shader for removng the background (background must be of solid colour) and display the video in AR.

Still the quality is not as good as in Unity I was getting. Right now it's only for Android Devices and chrome version 80.0+
